A simple and basic app that inputs the birth year and displays the user's age based on the current year.

Take Date of birth as an input from the user. Store the input in one variable

It will compare the Date of birth and Current date and check Leap year or not 

If its not a Leap Year it will calculate the Age and will show in Years and days 

After that it will show the calender of Birth ðŸŽ‚ and Current Month Calender and Highlights the given date and current date.
